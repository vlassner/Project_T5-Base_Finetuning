# DSML 4220 Project

This proposal is an important part of your project since it outlines exactly what you plan to do (what data to use, what model(s) to use and/or train, etc.). Although the project must involve Deep Learning, there is a broad range of possible project types you could choose from. The project could be about:

    training a Deep Learning model from scratch on a dataset of your choice (could be a Kaggle competition)
    fine-tuning an existing Deep Learning model on a dataset of your choice (could also be a Kaggle competition) 
    researching different models or configurations or models to benchmark/compare performance on a given task, or to illustrate a certain concept/phenomena (e.g demonstrating when/how Grokking happens, or comparing different word embedding   n     approaches/models)
    using an existing pre-trained Deep Learning model (or calling an API to external model) to accomplish a given task, or provide some functionality (ideally within an app or website)


Goal: Create a web app that allows a user to input a url for a news article and get a summary of the article. Wil be training a T5-small model and using a pre-built T5 Tokenizer to train with the CNN/Daily Mail daataset.
